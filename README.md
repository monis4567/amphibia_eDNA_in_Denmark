Supporting material for study on eDNA from amphibia in Denmark

The directory supma01 holds input files with qPCR data for in vitro tests

The directory supma02 holds code to analyse the qPCR data for in vitro tests

The directory supma03 holds input files with sampling collection data

The directory supma04 
and The directory supma05 holds raw input files with qPCR data prepared by students

The directory supma06 holds a bashcode that is used to fuse all raw qPCR text reports

The directory supma07 holds the resulting fusion of all text reports, that can be read by R

The directory supma08 holds all R code that is used to analyse the fused text reports
and prepare maps , and diagrams

The directory supma09 is produced by the first code in directory supma08, and all resulting plots and diagrams are written to this directory
